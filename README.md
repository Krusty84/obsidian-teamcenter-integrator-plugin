# Teamcenter Integrator Plugin: highlighting word occurrences

### ATTENTION! READ BEFORE!
Please note that to use this plugin, you must have access to the Teamcenter system from Siemens Digital Industries Software.  
As the plugin author, I assume you are familiar with Teamcenter, its purpose, how data is stored in it, and so on.

### Features
- While working in Obsidian.md, you can access Teamcenter to find the BOM you need.
Once found, you can import the BOM into Obsidian.mdâ€™s storage as a notebook structure. 
- Why do this? To make necessary notes related to BOM elements in a knowledge base format and link 
BOM elements to any other knowledge within your Obsidian.md.

  
- The BOM is imported with each item as a folder and each item revision as a note within that folder.

- Each note has a customizable and synchronized attribute section, along with a direct link to Teamcenter.

- In the settings, you can set Teamcenter-specific parameters (such as webtier name, AWC URL/port, etc.) and, importantly, 
specify the rule used for loading BOM item revisions.
